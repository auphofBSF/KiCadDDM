# KiCadDDM
KiCad Design Data Management (This tool suite is still at concept state). 



The vision for KiCadDDM is a suite of tools to enable the management and usefullness, improve workflow of schematic, component inventory  and pcb, through the smart use of the Electronic Design Data

It is  tool that interfaces KiCAD with Inventory and MRP systems, external vendors, and part reasearch and EDA tools such as Octopart and SnapEDA. , and simplifies the schematic component selection and workable BOM generation.

The tool extends the following eeschema interfaces
  Add Component interface
  Component Value/Footprint Edit
  Bom output
 
 The tool suite enables easy curating of an organizations parts and provides design data reports and key metric visibility
