# KiCadDDM
KiCad Design Data Management (This tool suite is still at concept state). 

Update Nov17 - [Kipartman] (https://github.com/turdusmerula/kipartman) *by @turdusmerula  has many of the key components of this suite. I am collaborating with Simon to extend and support the tool to hopefully be a part or be this vision*

---
# The vision
is for KiCadDDM as a suite of tools to enable improve workflow of schematic design, component inventory mangement and pcb design, through the smart use of the Electronic Design Data split over many systems and places

It is  tool that interfaces KiCAD with Inventory and MRP systems, external vendors, and part reasearch and EDA tools such as Octopart and SnapEDA. , and simplifies the schematic component selection and workable BOM generation.
## How
The tool suite extends the following KiCAD EESCHEMA dialogs or interfaces
- Add Component interface
- Component Value/Footprint Edit
- Bom output
 The tools suite provides Screens and Python API's for 
 - curating of an organizations parts
 - component selection
 - design data reports
    - Costing
    - Part availability
    - Inventory Buy Requests.
 - key metric visibility
 - Git based version control
